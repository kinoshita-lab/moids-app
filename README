About:
"moids-app.cpp" is an arduino program for our new artwork "moids 2.0".
You need at least arduino(pro, nano, duemilanove, etc.) to run this program.
We have confirmed this program works on aruduino-0012 version.

Being just a first commit, there are few information so far...
We will add schematics, libraries, docs for whole system in a few weeks.
Please wait for a while.
